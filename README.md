# E-can Django App

This repo was developed during my Graduate Reasearch Assistantship (GRA) at NYU.
It includes a Django application used to store garbage images and then classify them into classes with a Random Forest algorithm (using Histograms Of Oriented Gradients as input).

The objective was to [collect 360 degree images with a Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/jsmedmar/ecan_rpi) and track/classify them with the app.
